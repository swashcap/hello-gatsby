## Usage

Import the `Alert` component into a React component in your project:

```tsx
import {Alert} from 'demo-library';
```

Use `Alert` by passing children:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {Alert} from 'demo-library';

export const MyComponent: React.FC<any> = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Uh-oh<p>
      <Alert>
        <strong>Warning:</strong>
        This is a cautionary alert.
      </Alert>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Variants

`Alert` comes with three variations, which are set via the `variant` property.

### Success

Use to signify a positive or successful interaction. This is the default Alert.

```tsx live
<Alert variant="success">
  <strong>Success!</strong> This is a positive alert.
</Alert>
```

### Warning

Use to indicate bring awareness of a non-critical, potentially negative information.

```tsx live
<Alert variant="warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> This is a cautionary alert.
</Alert>
```

### Error

Use to convey a negative or errorful interaction or state.

```tsx live
<Alert variant="error">
  <strong>Error!</strong> This is a negative alert.
</Alert>
```

## Closeable

Pass an `onClose` property to the `Alert` to display a close button:

```tsx live
<Alert onClose={console.log} variant="warning">
  This alert is closeable.
</Alert>
```

The `Alert` component has a `focusButton` method that will call `HTMLElement.focus()` on the button.

## Accessibility

The `Alert` component has a `role="alert"` property, which covers the WCAG requirement.
